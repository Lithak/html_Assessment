        <b> I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. <br> 
            There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. <br>
            I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; <br>
            I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, <br>
            I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, <br>
            I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. <br>
            I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, <br>
            I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. <br>
            I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. <br>
            I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, <br>
            I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, <br>
            I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, <br>
            I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. <br>
            I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; </b></p>

        <p>
        I like good books and romantic movies. <br>
        I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, <br> 
        I like to Laugh. <br>
        I always wanted to be a great writer, <br>
        like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher". <br>
        They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, <br>
        like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read people’s mind. Of course, <br>
        I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, <br>
        some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive. <br>
        This is a brief introduction of myself. </p>
